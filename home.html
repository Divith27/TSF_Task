    <p>As the COVID-19 crisis continues to loom over us, The Government of India has taken a strict combat measure by directing a lockdown of the entire nation. At this great hour of need, The Above Fund has stepped in to provide relief by providing food to thousands of people across the country.</strong>. </p>
    <p>More than 200,000 people have died due to a second coronavirus surge in India and hundreds of thousands of people are infected each day. Many are unable to get the medical help they need. Donations to this fund will help treat patients and slow the spread of COVID-19 in India.</p>
